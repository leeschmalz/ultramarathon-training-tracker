this is really annoying, but don't want to spend time to figure out a better way.

step 1: 
put this in browser
https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=CLIENT&
redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080&
response_type=code&
scope=activity:read

(client id can be found in strava developer account online)

step 2:
click authorize, get code from url

step 3:

use the code from the url, run this in terminal:
curl -X POST https://www.strava.com/oauth/token \
     -F client_id=CLIENT \
     -F client_secret=SECRET \
     -F code=CODE \ 
     -F grant_type=authorization_code

(client id and secret can be found in strava developer account online, code from step 2)

step 4:
copy access token. this will have the scope accesses from step 1 for 6 hours
